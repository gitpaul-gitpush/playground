# Components Directory

This directory contains reusable React components.

Structure:
- atoms/      # Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- molecules/  # Simple combinations of atoms
- organisms/  # Complex combinations of molecules
- templates/  # Page-level component layouts

Each component should have its own directory containing:
- Component.tsx
- Component.test.tsx (optional)
- Component.styles.ts (optional)
- index.ts
