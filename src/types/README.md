# Types Directory

This directory contains TypeScript type definitions and interfaces used across the application.

Common files:
- models.ts     # Data model interfaces
- api.types.ts  # API related types
- props.ts      # Common component prop types
- store.ts      # State management types

Note: Component-specific types should be co-located with their components.
